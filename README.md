In the first week of the MSME Internship cum Skill Development Programme, we built a strong foundation in Python by exploring key concepts and applying them through hands-on exercises.

Day 1 & 2: We started with Python fundamentals, covering variables, data types, and string manipulation techniques. We also explored file system operations using the os module and began working with GUI development using Tkinter.

Day 3: Applied our learning by creating basic GUI applications, including a login page, calculator, and shopping discount calculator, using Tkinter elements like labels, buttons, and entry fields.

Day 4: Strengthened our understanding of fundamental operators and looping statements, reinforcing concepts with practical Tkinter exercises.

Day 5: Focused on Python’s core data structures—lists and tuples—learning essential methods for manipulation and efficient data handling.

This week laid the groundwork for deeper explorations into Python, combining theory with practical applications.

In the second week of the MSME Internship cum Skill Development Programme, we reinforced foundational Python concepts and expanded our knowledge into data structures and web development.

Day 6: Reviewed key learnings from the first week, including variables, data types, string manipulation, control flow, lists, tuples, and GUI development with Tkinter.

Day 7 & 10: Explored Python's core data structures—sets, dictionaries, and lists—understanding their properties, key methods, and practical applications, including a menu selection system.

Day 8 & 9: Transitioned into web development with Flask, working on projects such as a question-and-answer website and a student class management system, integrating HTML, CSS, and Python for both front-end and back-end functionality.

This week strengthened our grasp of Python's data-handling capabilities while introducing us to dynamic web application development.
